## 
**Intro**

Veovera Software Organization (aka VSO), a not-for-profit organization, was formed in 2022 to help enhance software for public good. VSO has published a new technical document(s) to support enhancements to RTMP. Additionally, Veovera has welcomed new members to the organization including Adobe, YouTube and Veriskope.


## 
**Abstract**

There have been ongoing requests from the media streaming industry to enhance the RTMP/FLV solution by bringing the protocol up to date with the current state of the art streaming technologies. RTMP was released over 20 years ago and many streaming solutions use it in their stack today. While RTMP has remained popular it has gone stale in its evolution. As an example RTMP/FLV did not have support for popular video codecs like VP9, HEVC, AV1. That is until now! The document [enhanced-rtmp.pdf](https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp/blob/main/enhanced-rtmp-v1.pdf) outlines new enhancements to the RTMP/FLV specification to help bring RTMP protocol inline with the current streaming media technologies. Furthermore Veovera and its members are working on a fast follow with additional capabilities to continue to modernize RTMP. Whatâ€™s immediately on our roadmap is to complement the recent video codec enhancements with additional popular audio codecs. At the top of our list is Opus, AC-3 and E-AC-3. In addition to continued codec support we are looking to add support for a seamless reconnect command. Our goal is to continue to enhance RTMP while staying backwards compatible without breaking the internet or current tooling. Please stay tuned for the fast follow details and the continued enhancements that will come after that!
