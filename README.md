## Intro

Veovera Software Organization (aka VSO), a not-for-profit organization, was formed to help enhance software for the public good. VSO has published a new technical document(s) here to support enhancements to RTMP. Additionally, Veovera has welcomed new members to the organization including Adobe, Google and Veriskope.


## Abstract

There are ongoing requests from the media streaming industry to enhance the RTMP/FLV solution by bringing the protocol up to date with the current state of the art streaming technologies. RTMP was released over 20 years ago (The first public release of RTMP was in 2002). Many streaming solutions use RTMP in their stack today. While RTMP has remained popular it has gone a bit stale in its evolution. As an example RTMP/FLV does not have support for popular video codecs like VP9, HEVC, AV1. The document [enhanced-rtmp.pdf](https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp/blob/main/enhaced-rtmp.pdf) outlines enhancements to the RTMP/FLV specification to help bring this protocol inline with the current streaming media technologies by adding new capabilities to it. There will be future versioned updates to the enhancement spec, where each new version will cover new scope and new features. We will always aim to be backwards-compatible. The goal is to continue to enhance the RTMP protocol to be on par with today's streaming technologies and beyond. Please stay tuned.
