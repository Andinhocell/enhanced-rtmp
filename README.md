## Intro

Founded in 2022, the Veovera Software Organization (VSO) is a dedicated not-for-profit entity committed to enhancing software technology for the public good. VSO has played a pivotal role in advancing the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), notably through collaboration with industry leaders such as Adobe, YouTube, Twitch and others. Our collective efforts focus on refining and broadening the capabilities of RTMP to ensure it meets the evolving demands of modern media streaming.

## Abstract

As the media streaming landscape continues to evolve, the VSO has emerged as a pivotal force in modernizing the RTMP/FLV protocol, a cornerstone of streaming technology that had remained largely unaltered for over two decades. Through our pioneering initiatives, we have introduced initial enhancements “[enhanced-rtmp-v1](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v1)” (or "[enhanced-rtmp-v1.pdf"](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v1.pdf)) and the latest alpha specification, "[enhanced-rtmp-v2](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v2)" (or "[enhanced-rtmp-v2.pdf"](https://veovera.github.io/enhanced-rtmp/docs/enhanced/enhanced-rtmp-v2.pdf)). This key publication outlines substantial advancements to RTMP, including:

- Integration of advanced video codecs (VP8, VP9, HEVC, AV1) with High Dynamic Range (HDR) support, catering to modern displays and content requirements.
- Addition of VideoPacketType.Metadata, expanding the range of supported video metadata types.
- Introduction of video Multitrack capabilities, allowing for the management and processing of multiple video streams concurrently.
- Implementation of a Reconnect Request feature, aimed at improving connection stability and resilience.

These enhancements are designed to align RTMP with contemporary streaming technology standards, ensuring its relevance and efficacy in today's digital landscape. \
&nbsp; \
Additionally, we are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of audio quality and functionality by integrating leading audio codecs such as Opus, FLAC, AC-3, and E-AC-3 into our offerings. We are also excited about the forthcoming features for multitrack and multichannel audio configurations, aiming to enhance your auditory experience without sacrificing compatibility with existing setups. These audio enhancements, following closely on the heels of our latest update, underscore our commitment to innovation while maintaining backward compatibility.
