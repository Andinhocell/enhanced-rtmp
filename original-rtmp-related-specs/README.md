# Abstract

The Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) was designed to support very low-latency interactions in multiparty applications. It seamlessly integrates live or recorded video, broadcast streaming, and video-on-demand (VOD) functionalities. Original RTMP-related specifications can be found in [this GitHub folder](https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp/tree/main/original-rtmp-related-specs). Below are links to normative references hosted on GitHub, which are essential for understanding the intricacies of RTMP and implementing its enhanced version.
